## 🔧 Core Components

### 1. LangGraph Workflow Engine
```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Input] --> B[Rules Engine]
    B --> C[Reasoning Node]
    C --> D[Tool Selection]
    D --> E[Response Generation]
    E --> F[Output]
```

**Purpose**: Orchestrates the entire conversation flow
**Technology**: LangGraph StateGraph
**Features**:
- State management across conversation turns
- Conditional routing based on user needs

### 2. Rules Engine
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[User Input] --> B{Safety Rules}
    B -->|Emergency| C[Emergency Response]
    B -->|Safe| D{General Rules}
    D -->|Match| E[Direct Response]
    D -->|No Match| F{Health Rules}
    F -->|Match| G[Health Tool]
    F -->|No Match| H{Skincare Rules}
    H -->|Match| I[Skincare Tool]
    H -->|No Match| J[Reasoning Node]
```

**Purpose**: Provides fast, deterministic responses for known patterns
**Priority Order**:
1. **Safety Rules** (Highest priority)

- **Cultural health practices** and diverse perspectives

## 📊 Data Flow Architecture

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant U as User
    participant W as Workflow
    participant R as Rules Engine
    participant T as Tools
    participant K as Knowledge Base
    participant A as AI Model

    U->>W: User Input
    W->>R: Process Input
    R->>R: Safety Check
    alt Emergency Detected
        R->>U: Emergency Response
    else Safe to Proceed
        R->>R: Rule Matching
        alt Rule Found
            R->>U: Direct Response
        else No Rule Match
            R->>T: Route to Tool
            T->>K: Query Knowledge Base
            T->>A: AI Processing
            A->>T: Generated Response
            T->>W: Tool Response
            W->>U: Final Response
        end
    end
```

## 🛡️ Safety Architecture

### Multi-Layer Safety System

1. **Input Validation**
   - Harmful content detection
   - Intent classification
   - Risk assessment

2. **Emergency Detection**
   - Crisis keyword matching
   - Severity assessment

## 🔄 State Management

The system maintains conversation state through:

### Conversation Memory
```python
{
    "user_input": "Current user message",
    "chat_history": ["Previous messages"],
    "intermediate_steps": ["Processing steps"],
    "context": {"User preferences", "Health profile"},
    "final_response": "Generated response"
}
```

### Persistent Context
- **User preferences** and health profile
- **Previous consultations** and recommendations
- **Ongoing health tracking** (cycles, symptoms)
- **Personalization data** for improved responses

## 🎨 User Experience Flow
