# Enhanced Greeting & Crisis Response System

## 🎯 Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive enhancements made to the Ara Health Agent's greeting and crisis response system, addressing the key issues of static responses and inadequate mental health crisis handling.

## 🔧 Key Improvements

### 1. Dynamic Greeting System

**Previous Problem:**
- Static, repetitive greetings that felt robotic
- Same templated responses regardless of context
- No personalization based on user's greeting style

**Enhanced Solution:**
- **Dynamic LLM-based greetings** using specialized prompts
- **Context-aware responses** that match user's energy and style
- **Cultural sensitivity** for diverse greeting patterns
- **Time-based personalization** (morning, evening, etc.)

### 2. Enhanced Crisis Response System

**Previous Problem:**
- Basic, generic crisis responses
- Limited suicide detection patterns
- Clinical, impersonal language for life-threatening situations

**Enhanced Solution:**
- **Comprehensive crisis detection** with 20+ trigger patterns
- **Compassionate, personalized responses** using specialized prompts
- **Immediate resource provision** with prominent crisis hotlines
- **Validation and hope** while maintaining urgency

## 📁 Files Modified

### New Files Created:
1. **`prompts/greeting_prompt.txt`** - Specialized greeting generation prompt
2. **`prompts/crisis_prompt.txt`** - Crisis response generation prompt
3. **`test_enhanced_system.py`** - Comprehensive testing suite

### Modified Files:
1. **`rules/rules_engine.py`** - Enhanced with dynamic response routing
2. **`src/agent/response.py`** - Added specialized prompt handling
3. **`src/agent/workflow.py`** - Updated routing logic
4. **`rules/general_rules.json`** - Removed static greetings

## 🏗️ Architecture Changes

### Before (Static System):
```
User Greeting → Rules Engine → Static Response → Output
```

### After (Dynamic System):
```
User Greeting → Rules Engine → LLM + Specialized Prompt → Personalized Response → Output
```

## 🧪 New Functions Added

### `rules/rules_engine.py`:
- `is_greeting(user_input)` - Intelligent greeting detection
- `is_crisis_situation(user_input)` - Enhanced crisis detection
- Enhanced `rule_engine_node()` with dynamic routing

### `src/agent/response.py`:
- `load_prompt(prompt_file)` - Specialized prompt loading
- Enhanced `response_node()` with context-aware generation

## 🎨 Greeting Enhancement Details

### Dynamic Greeting Features:
- **Energy Matching**: Matches user's casual/formal tone
- **Cultural Awareness**: Handles "namaste", "bonjour", etc.
- **Time Sensitivity**: Contextual responses for "good morning", etc.

### Example Transformations:

**Before (Static):**
```
User: "Hey"
Ara: "Hey! Welcome! I'm Ara, your friendly AI companion for women's health and skincare. I can help you with skincare routines, period tracking, PCOS information, and more. What's on your mind today?"
```

**After (Dynamic):**
```
User: "Hey"
Ara: "Hey there! 😊 I'm excited to help you with whatever you need - what would you like to explore?"
```
